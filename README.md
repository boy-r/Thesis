# Can the Best Prediction Be the Worst Imputation?

### Abstract
In the occurrence of missing data, handling the missingness through imputation can be a holy grail that allows for analyses of hypothetically complete data. The selection of an appropriate imputation method is important to prevent bias and wrong inferences. A measure commonly used to evaluate imputation method performance is to measure the difference between the imputed data and the true data, referred to as the root mean squared error (RMSE). However, the usefulness of using the RMSE may be questioned. The current study compares various imputation methods on commonly used performance measures to examine the differences between given performance indications. Data comes from simulations (nsim = 500) based on a case study. It is found that selecting an imputation method based on best performance according to RMSE would result in the selection of a method that leads to systematically biased regression coefficients, overestimating the proportion of explained variance and below nominal coverage rates. These results hold for various missingness scenarios. Recommendations are given on methods to evaluate imputation method performance and future use of the RMSE. The best predictions do not result in the best imputations.
